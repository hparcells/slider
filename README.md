A 2D platformer game made in Unity for the [2-Buttons Jam 2018](https://itch.io/jam/2-buttons-jam-2018).

### The Game
The one key feature of this game is that, you can't jump. As you progress through the game, the rooms go from simplistic and easy, to a puzzle filled room, where you have to use different items and blocks to help yourself.

### Controls
- â€‹Left: Move Left
- Right: Move Right
- Left + Right: Reset Level
